#+title: Contribution guidelines

In short: contributions always welcome :).

* Reporting issues

  When reporting an issue, please provide your OS and Emacs versions.

  I apologize for, at times, being slow to respond to issues. I usually read them immediately
  after I get a notification, but in the more busy periods, I'm slow to respond. But I'll always
  get to addressing them eventually :).

* Fixes and new code

  Send a pull request. I'll review it and merge it in if it looks OK.

* Why did I put these guidelines here?
  Because I was curious about the new GitHub feature, that's why :).
